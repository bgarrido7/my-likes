# My Likes
Hello There :wave:
This is a simple website designed to gather all my favorites — from movies and TV shows to video games and books — in one place. Instead of jumping between different platforms, this lets me organize and revisit everything you love in one simple space.

I created this app as a way to learn and experiment with a frontend framework that I haven't worked with before, in this case Vue.js

Check it Out :point_right: [Here](https://bgarrido7.github.io/my-likes/) 

## To run the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deploy to page

```bash
npm run deploy
```


## When finished with a new increment

```bash
npm run submit -- "some commit message"
```
